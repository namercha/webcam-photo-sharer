# Webcam Photo Sharer 
This python program demonstrates capturing an image and adding the ability to share it on the internet.
It uses the Kivy library to create a GUI window which can start the user's webcam. The user can take an image with the webcam. Once an image is taken,
other buttons are generated. One button creates a sharable link, another button copies the link and finally the third one opens the link.
